\hrule
\emph{Programmer}, \textbf {Recurse Center}, New York City, NY, Sept. - Dec. 2015 \\ 
\begin{small}$\cdot$ {Full-time, three-month educational retreat for software developers dedicated to self-improvement, personal focus on Python}\\ 
$\cdot$ {Building a \href{https://github.com/vzhz/function_generator/blob/master/README.md}{function generator} to facilitate cross-dataset comparisons of climate data that requires no programming expertise using JavaScript, jQuery, HTML, Mako, TurboGears 2, Python, \& MongoDB}\\
$\cdot$ {Developed \href{https://github.com/vzhz/geography_guessing_game/blob/master/README.md}{Geography Guessing Game}, a terminal memory game written in Python that uses modular, recursive functions, object-oriented programming, and automated unit testing}\end{small}

\smallskip
\emph{Research Engineer}, \textbf {Schlumberger-Doll Research Center Petrolabs}, Cambridge, MA, Mar. - Dec. 2014 \\ 
\begin{small}$\cdot$ {Prepared samples, collected mineralogy data, and presented findings for projects validating software-derived results}
$\cdot$ {Used domain knowledge of regional geology of a variety of formations to confirm lab results}\\
$\cdot$ {Rebuilt mineral sample standards library, increasing the number of standards from 34 to 75, more than doubling the number of minerals that could be used to calibrate instruments and allowing better mineral identification}\end{small} 

\smallskip
\emph {Research Assistant}, \textbf {MIT Paleomagnetism Laboratory}, Cambridge, MA, Jan. 2012 - Oct. 2013 \\ 
\begin{small}$\cdot$ {Performed conglomerate test and alternating field demagnetization on early-earth rocks in order to identify the oldest known terrestial magnetization and determine when the field originated} \\
$\cdot$ {Improved procedure for removing contaminants from sample disks by adjusting the time and sonicating the disks during acid wash, allowing single-cast samples to be measured percisely} \\
$\cdot$ {Introduced silicone fittings to allow disk-mounted samples to be measured using the automated sample changer, allowing up to 200 disk-mounted, single-clast samples to be run in sequence and saving over 30 hours of labor per run} \\
$\cdot$ {Designed drill press cooling system for extracting rock cores and sample holder to cut cores on a saw designed for rock hand samples}\end{small}

\smallskip
\emph{Data Intern}, \textbf{NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory}, Pasadena, CA, Jan.-- Aug. 2009 \\
\begin{small}$\cdot$ {Led student effort to determine rock distributions for possible landing sites for the Mars Curiosity rover }\\
$\cdot$ {Mentored three students, teaching them pertinent geology concepts and introduced them to in-house software that was being devopled for our project }\\
$\cdot$ {Collaborated with software lead to implement improvements by providing user UX/UI feedback and noting bugs identified during use }\\
$\cdot$ {Developed assessment criteria for the hazards identified by software and methods to incorporate these distributions into GIS datasets }\\
$\cdot$ {Maintained ArcGIS database and prepared existing data for landing site selection }\end{small}
